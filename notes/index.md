# Couscous Mintlook

![](https://static.mo-mar.de/couscous-mintlook-mockup.jpg)

[Live Example](https://moqmar.github.io/shell-setup/)

## Features

- Search function
- Language selection
- Pagination (previous/next)
- Syntax highlighting
- Customizable sidebar and footer
- Configurable accent color

## Usage

To use the template, set it up in your `couscous.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
template:
    url: https://github.com/moqmar/mintlook-couscous
```

You should also add the file [`404.md`](https://github.com/moqmar/mintlook-couscous/blob/master/404.md) to your documentation and configure your webserver to point to `/404.html` on missing pages.

A file `icon.png` in the project root (`baseUrl`) will be used as a favicon.

## Configuration
```yaml
title: Couscous # Page Title
logo: https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ie_Shine/128/shine_19.png # Icon URL
color: "#d21"   # Accent color

languages: ["en", "de"] # List of supported languages. Comment out to disable language selection.
defaultLanguage: world  # Default language icon, and the value of the html lang attribute. It is recommended to set this even (especially) if you're not using language selection.

search: true # Enable search
scripts:
    after:
        - php .couscous/generated/.scripts/generate-search-index.php # Required for search
        - rm -rf .couscous/generated/.scripts # Clean up unneccessary files

sidebar:
    - title: About mintlook
    - subtitle: Links
    - text: Homepage
      link: https://moqmar.github.io/mintlook # absolute link
    - text: Mintlook and Couscous
      page: / # relative link
    - line: true
    - html: |
            <p>Follow us on <a href="">Facebook</a>, <a href="">Twitter</a>, and other <a href="">social networks</a>.</p>
# you can also define the sidebar per language
sidebar:
  de:
    - title: Ãœber mintlook
  default: # fallback for all other languages
    - title: About mintlook

footer: |
    Hello <strong>World</strong>
# you can also define the footer per language
footer: # fallback for all other languages
  de: Hallo <strong>Welt</strong>
  default: Hello <strong>World</strong>
```

### Language selection
If the `languages` configuration option is set, you should have a directory structure in the form of `/<language>/<...>`, with the pages in the `defaultLanguage` located at just `/<...>` - e.g. **/de/something.html** for the german version and **/something.html** for the english version.

Setting the `defaultLanguage` to `world`, enforces the `/<language>/<...>` structure for all sites, and shows a world map instead of a flag for the language selection on pages not adhering to that structure.

You can also override the displayed language for a single file using the `pageLanguage` metadata field.

If you want to automatically go to the user's browser language, you can use the following `index.html` file in your repository:

```html
<!doctype html>
<!-- default language -->
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=en/">
<!-- browser language -->
<script>
var supportedLanguages = ["en", "de"]; // Should be the same as in couscous.yml
for (var i in navigator.languages) if (supportedLanguages.indexOf(navigator.languages[i]) > -1) {
    location.replace(navigator.languages[i] + "/"); break;
}
</script>
```

### Document metadata
```yaml
noIndex: false              # if true, the document will be excluded from search index

description: A page.        # description as shown in search, also used for metaDescription if not explicitly set
metaDescription: A page.    # description as used for the <meta name="description"> content

pageLanguage: en            # language of the page

prev: /page-before.md       # previous page if pagination is used
prevTitle: The Page Before  # title of previous page (default would be "page-before" here)

next: /test/example.md      # next page if pagination is used
nextTitle: An example page  # title of next page (default would be "example" here)
```
